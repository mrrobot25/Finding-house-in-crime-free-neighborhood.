# Crime Free Neighborhood

I used foursquare api to pull the list of top 100 venues within 500 meters of radius. I created a Foursquare developer account in order to obtain account ID and API key to pull the data from Foursquare, I pulled the names, categories, latitude, and longitude of the venues. With this data, I can
also check how many unique categories that I can get from these venues.Then, I analyzed each neighborhood by grouping the rows by neighborhood and taking the mean on the frequency of occurrence of each venue category.
